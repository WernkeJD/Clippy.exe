HELLO! thank you for checking out our MAKEUC 2024 project. This repo allows users to copy and paste accross OS's and computers in a secure way to improve convienence, security, and development speed. In order to run this code we have neatly packaged two VM's. One for Windows users and one for Mac users. In order to run the code simply clone the repo, go to the folder you stored it in, and select either the windows .bat file or the mac_run.command file and follow the steps the code provides!

Thanks, and any feedback is appreciated!
